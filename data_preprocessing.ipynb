    "- Uses a fixed URL syntax that translates a standard set of input parameters into the values necessary for various NCBI software components to search for and retrieve the requested data.\n",
    "- The E-utilities are therefore the structured interface to the Entrez system, which currently includes 38 databases covering a variety of biomedical data, including nucleotide and protein sequences, gene records, three-dimensional molecular structures, and the biomedical literature.\n",
    "- To access data, a piece of software posts an E-utility URL to NCBI, then retrieves the results of this and processes the data.\n",
    "- It can use any computer languages that can send a URL to the E-utilities server and interpret the XML response (i.e. Python, Perl, Java, C++).\n",
    "- NCBI requests that users limit requests to no more than 3 per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, I have gleaned that I can use a combination of **ESearch** and **EFetch** to find and retrieve the data I want.\n",
    "\n",
