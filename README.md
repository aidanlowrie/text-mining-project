## Exploring the Potential of Transformer Models as a Novel Approach to Biological Knowledge Graph Construction

## Abstract
Biological data is littered with complex terms and relationships. One way to represent these relationships is through Knowledge Graphs. Over the past half decade, transformer models have revolutionised many NLP tasks. BERT models have been increasingly employed in other academic spheres for KG creation. Throughout this project, we explored the potential for transformer models within the field of biology, evaluating their ability to generate high quality triples through qualitatively (through visualisation) and quantitatively (through training predictive models).

## Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

## Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show you've read the docs and are familiar with some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
Add here a sketch of your planning for the coming weeks. Please mention who does what.

## Documentation
This can be added as the project unfolds. You should describe, in particular, what your repo contains and how to reproduce your results.
